Rafaël Rozendaal

Rafaël Rozendaal explores pleasurable visuals featured on single page websites. 
Drawing inspiration from the past and modernism, his immaterial work has been displayed in large scale 
museum exhibitions as well as on the home monitors of anyone who connects to his multiple domains. 
Works like Rozendaal’s are contributing towards bridging the gap that still lies between traditional 
art institutions and net.art. 


Many of Rozendaal art work feature some kind of interaction from the user. They provide engagement and 
make the art feel alive and memorable by catching the viewer’s attention. This is something that the WEB makes 
possible and relatively easy for creators.

“I am not a traditional artist. I intend to create work that is original and unique in style and presentation. 
[…] netart involves a visual display for the viewing pleasure of the spectator”[1]
