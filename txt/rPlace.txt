r/place

The western internet world has been greatly influenced by the website Reddit.com since it’s creation in 2005. 
On April 1st 2017, administrators of the website created a social experiment exploring the importance of the 
individual and collaborative efforts in order to achieve complex creations. Place was organized as a 1000x1000 
pixel canvas on which any user could add a single pixel of color every 20 to 5 minutes. The Reddit hosted site 
lasted for 72 hours and featured anything from pop culture to video games, politics and social issues. Over one 
million users interacted with the website and the experiment is considered for its representation of the culture 
of Reddit’s online communities and the Internet as a whole.

Ars Technica writer cited: “the cooperative spirit of Place represented a model for fighting 
extremism in internet communities.”[1]

Among the notable events, one that hits particularly close to home has been titled: “The battle of Québec”.
The members of the reddit community r/quebec had to fight the expansion of the Canadian flag onto their own.
Reminiscing of the English conquest over the French colonies of North America, the final canvas of Place features 
Quebec’s patriotic flag as well as the date 1837, year of the Lower Canada Rebellion, the Patriot's war.
