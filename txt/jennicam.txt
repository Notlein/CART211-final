In the 90s, live streaming of reality started to appear on the WEB. The Coffee Pot cam and a camera
rigged fishbowl are some of the first exemples, but Jennicam was the first to feature a real 
person. 19-year-old at the time, Jennifer Ringley streamed her life with a webcam on the internet 
for anyone to witness at every hour of every day. Her project lasted from 1996 to 2003. During 
that time, she gained the attention of mainstream media and even featured on David Letterman's 
Late Night show in 1998.

Exploring concepts of solitude and self-expression, her project beggs the question:
"Do we regain in community, or democracy, or openness what we lose in privacy or possession?" [1]
From a pre-internet perspective, this project feels inconceivable and, at the time, felt like a 
boundary pushing exploration between physical bodies and virtual selves.  
We can see how jennicam paved the way for the millions of streamers that followed; exploring 
individual, virtual, digital, artificial and social concepts ever since.
