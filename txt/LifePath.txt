Lifepatch

In a context of increasing unrest, financial crisis, and rising censorship and surveillance, a community 
response like the one net.art has always offered seems more necessary than ever.

Lifepatch.org is a citizen initiative that works with the arts, science and technology domain. 
Their projects involve innovative and creative developments such as biological, environmental and digital technology. 
For exemple, in 2011 – 2013, the Jogja River Project “invited citizens to investigate water quality of the rivers 
in urban areas of Yogyakarta while also documenting the social activities of the communities along the riverbanks.”[1] 

Utilising the internet to connect and explore solutions regarding the ongoing crisis in the world has become synonymous with the net.art of today.
